  <h4>Course 2</h4>
  <p>During Course 2 we learned how to make a HTTP GET Request with Flutter
and later on also how to make a Model class

We made a request from yts.mx which does not require an api key

To run this you need to create a "Run/Debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA
with Dart console application and select this file which as you can see has the main method</p>
  <h4>Course 4</h4>
  <p>During course 4 we learned some methods for String manipulation in Dart. After that we used the aquired skill in order to scrap information fram an HTTP Request from https://www.worldometers.info and create a GridView with countries flags and name. For this we had to take the body from the HTTP request and extract the information we needed</p>
