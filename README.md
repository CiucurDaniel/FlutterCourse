  <p>During course 4 we learned some methods for String manipulation in Dart. After that we used the aquired skill in order to scrap information fram an HTTP Request from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info">Worldometers website</a> and create a GridView with countries flags and name. For this we had to take the body from the HTTP request and extract the information we needed</p>
