  #Course 1
  Course 1 was simply an `introduction to Flutter` with some quick code demos and a presentations of the advantages and features of Flutter.
  
  #Course 2
  During Course 2 we learned how to make a `HTTP GET Request` with Flutter
and later on also how to make a `Model class`

We made a request from yts.mx which does not require an api key

To run this you need to create a "Run/Debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA
with Dart console application and select this file which as you can see has the main method</p>
  #Course 4
  During course 4 we learned some methods for `String manipulation` in Dart. After that we used the aquired skill in order to scrap information fram an HTTP Request from [Worldometers website](https://www.worldometers.info) and create a GridView with countries flags and name. For this we had to take the body from the HTTP request and extract the information we needed.
  
  Course 6
  During course 6 we learned how to use `Freezed package` in order to `generate code for immutable objects`. Go to [Freezed package](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed)
